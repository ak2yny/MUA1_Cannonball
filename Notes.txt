- For the xtreme (was it?) it's probably better to use velocity instead of slidemove.
- For the blast effect, use Ironman's effect.
  He has smoke which is visible when you jump normally. (Or was it when you don't have enough energy to fly? Is that possible?)
  His flight effect might work for the "flames". Both effects need to be scaled.
